# Ness-Habit-Tracker

## About The Project

This project was created as a comprehensive solution for people in need of a tool for improving their habits. Ness, the application, has powerful data analysis modules and user-friendly habit management panels that will help the user track and extract valuable information from habits. 

## Built With
Ness has been built with as few dependencies as possible to secure cross platform compatibility. The entire application is programmed on Python 3.9 and only makes use of standard libraries included in the standard Python installation package. The following standard libraries has been utilized:
•	datetime
•	json
•	re
•	tkinter

## Getting Started
Ness can run on MacOS, Windows or Linux. If you plan on running Ness from its standalone version there is no need for installing or updating Python. However, Python 3.7 or greater must be installed if you want to run it from its source code via your preferred terminal console. For more information on installing and updating Python please refer to its official website at https://www.python.org/downloads/ and download the latest version available. Instructions for the installation procedure are available in https://www.python.org/downloads/ as well.

My Habits Panel
This panel displays the habits pending for every specific day of the week the user is using the app. Clicking on the “Done” button will register one completion cycle for the habit. Each specific habit needs to be completed as many times in a day as the pre-defined daily goal. Once the user has hit the daily goal for any specific habit, the “Done” button for that habit will change to “Completed” and will be disabled. To visualize the data and insights gathered click the “H STAST!” button.
Manage My Habits Panel
This panel displays the ALL habits defined by the user. The user can check all parameters for every single active habit. The parameter displayed are: Time, Habit Name, Daily Goal, and Frequency. Each habit listed has a “Delete” button. If clicked, the user will permanently delete all data associated with the selected habit. 
Clocked Habits Panel
This panel is used to track habits within a timed session. The user can user the “Set Habit” button to define new clocked habits. To start a session, click on the “Start Session” button. Ness will push a notification every time the stopwatch hits the targeted frequency for each active habit. To user can then select to either skip the habit or mark it as completed. To end the session, click the “End Session” button. To visualize the data gathered from the last 10 sessions, click the “C STAST!” button.
New Habits Panel
This panel allows the user to interactively define and create a new habit. The user must enter the habit’s name, its targeted daily frequency (i.e., the number of times the habits should be done on a daily base), the days of the week the user wishes to do the habit, and a general time frame for completion (i.e., morning, afternoon, evening, all time). Once all parameters are defined, the user can proceed to press the “Add” button and the habit will be added to the database.
